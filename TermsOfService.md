# VideoSpace's Terms Of Service

## Age Limit

VideoSpace follows along with COPPA, and YouTube DOES NOT follow COPPA, as they collect data from you.
However, VideoSpace DOES NOT ask for any info except for a name for your VideoSpace channel, and what you are to upload to VideoSpace,
(.mp4, .webm, .mp2, .avi, etc.) 

HOWEVER, even though VideoSpace DOES FOLLOW COPPA, and kids CAN USE THE SERVICE to upload videos, we've set an age limit for the service.

You MUST be at 7 years old or over 7 years old to use VideoSpace.

Under-age people will have their channel TERMINATED, unless they are with a family member OVER 7 years old.

## Swearing

VideoSpace restricts swearing to make VideoSpace a better community for children to explore and watch videos online.

Swearing is restricted to god, heck and stupid. Anything other than that is too harsh and WILL get you muted for 3 days the first time.

Table:
3 days - First Swear in Video
7 days - Second Swear in Video
14 days - Third Swear in Video
Ban for 3 days - Forth Swear in Video
Ban for life - Fifth Swear in Video

After 5 swears in videos (or all in one video), you will get permanently BANNED from the platform.

## End

Thank you for reading the terms of service for VideoSpace. If you meet and agree to ALL of these conditions, you shall make
a VideoSpace channel!
